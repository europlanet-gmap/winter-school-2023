        "- Years went by, Jupyter _Notebook_ evolved into a better interface: **Jupyter _Lab_** (or Jupyter-Lab, or JupyterLab); The fundamental functionality is the same: provision of a feature-rich interface around _notebooks_ to document and run interactively (Python) code.\n",
        "- Finally, **Jupyter _Hub_** (Jupyter-Hub, JupyterHub) is a manager for multiple _Notebook_ or _Lab_ instances. It is used in a multi-user and distributed computing environment to control access and launch Jupyter-* instances.\n",

        "\n",
        "For instance, QGIS provides a whole environment for georeferenced data analysis; It is provides such environment through a _graphical interface_ and can be extended through Python plugins.\n",

        "In our case, though, the _data science environment_ we talking about is one step lower, at the command-line and/or Python code; Complementary to QGIS for whenever we need more control over the processing or -- effectively -- specific tools that go beyond georeferenced data: _planetary data_.\n",
