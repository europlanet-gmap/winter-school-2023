    "\n",
    "This notebook contains an example of a typical workflow to process HiRISE Stereo pairs with [NASA ASP](https://stereopipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html)\n",

    "## **HiRISE Instrument**\n",
    "\n",
    "HiRISE is a camera on board the Mars Recoinnassance Orbiter (MRO), orbiting Mars since 2006, and capable of acquiring images with a spatial resolution up to 0.3 meters/pixel from an orbit altitude of 300 km.\n",

    "## **ASP Input Files**\n",
    "\n",
    "Common input file for HiRISE processing, consists in an HiRISE stereo pair (images of the same area acquired with a different angle from a different orbit, simulating native stereo camera acqusitions (e.g., MEX HRSC).\n",
    "Each image needs to be processed using ISIS HiRISE's workflow to obtain a normalized calibrated CUB file.\n",
