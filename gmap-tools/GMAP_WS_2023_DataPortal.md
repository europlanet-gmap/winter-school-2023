# GMAP Data publication

In this session we are going to see how to publish a planetary data package on a platform like Zenodo. There is a discussion about the metadata relevant for describing planetary data and how to present them to the user through general-purpose data management systems.

After presenting GMAP Data Portal, I will present the metadata model we use to describe our data packages (_i.e._, maps), and _teach_ you how to use such software; Either through the graphical user interface, as well as programmatically.
GMAP Data Portal is an instance of InvenioRDM, the open-source software behind Zenodo, running on our premises, https://data.europlanet-gmap.eu.
