# QGIS

The winter school will use the latest version of [QGIS](https://qgis.org) available. Materials have been tested on version 3.28 and 3.22 (LTR).

Please refer to the [documentation](https://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html).

A dedicate [troubleshooting](qgis-troubleshooting.md) page is available, with tips and caveats related to the 2023 winter school.
