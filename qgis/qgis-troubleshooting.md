# QGIS Tips & troubleshooting for the 2023 Winter School

The information in this document refers to QGIS 3.28 and issues, behaviour might slightly differ across version and platforms.

> **Note**
> This is a live compilation of tips for using QGIS during the 2023 GMAP Winter School. They do not aim at being universal. It might be possible that platform or system-specific issues can arise.  Please be patient, either asking for help or looking for solutions yourself on the web.

## QGIS Installation

Please install the latest versions of QGIS, either **3.28.2 or 3.22 LTR** from  https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html 

**Prior versions will not work properly** with our plugins or mapping projects.

## QGIS custom projections

Data provided for the hands-on are already pre-projected in metric coordinates (Equirectangular). This might be greatly eased in the future, e.g. if planetary projections are included by default within QGIS (see Hare and Malapert, 2021, linked from [CRS](https://github.com/europlanet-gmap/winter-school-2023/tree/main/crs).

It might be useful to set the QGIS project properties accordingly. 

In order to add custom projections one could use the **Settings â†’ Custom projections**
